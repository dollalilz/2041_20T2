- style 15/15
  - Code is very readable with sensible variable names and good separation of sections.
  - The addition of functions was a nice touch. A good amount of comments in the code.
- test-suite 4.5/5
  - Overall tests were well written, and test a wide range of cases. Each command
  - has a good amount of testing.                                               
  - 0.5 would've liked some comments explaining what you're trying to test

  + =============================================== +
 + Generally good commenting of major blocks and   +
 + your logic. Great decomposition into functions  +
 + and sensible var names. A redundant             +
 + commented-out line of code here and there       +
 + that's good to get rid of for readability.      +
 + Whitespace/indents could be a tad more          +
 + consistent in parts but overall reasonably neat +
 + =============================================== +
- test 5/5
 + ============================================== +
 + Tests cover some good cases and appear to have +
 + been thoughtfully put together, well done!     +
